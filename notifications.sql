An average club player has a rating of about 1500; the highest FIDE rating of all time, 2882, was achieved by Magnus Carlsen on the March 2014 FIDE rating list.[14]\r\n\r\nPlayers may be awarded lifetime titles by FIDE:[16]\r\n\r\n    Grandmaster (GM; sometimes International Grandmaster or IGM is used) is awarded to world-class chess masters. Apart from World Champion, Grandmaster is the highest title a chess player can attain. Before FIDE will confer the title on a player, the player must have an Elo rating of at least 2500 at one time and three results of a prescribed standard (called norms) in tournaments involving other grandmasters, including some from countries other than the applicant\'s. There are other milestones a player can achieve to attain the title, such as winning the World Junior Championship.\r\n    International Master (IM). The conditions are similar to GM, but less demanding. The minimum rating for the IM title is 2400.\r\n    FIDE Master (FM). The usual way for a player to qualify for the FIDE Master title is by achieving a FIDE rating of 2300 or more.\r\n    Candidate Master (CM). Similar to FM, but with a FIDE rating of at least 2200.\r\n\r\nThe above titles are open to both men and women. There are also separate women-only titles; Woman Grandmaster (WGM), Woman International Master (WIM), Woman FIDE Master (WFM) and Woman Candidate Master (WCM). These require a performance level approximately 200 Elo rating points below the similarly named open titles, and their continued existence has sometimes been controversial. Beginning with Nona Gaprindashvili in 1978, a number of women have earned the open GM title: 40 as of July 2023.[note 2]\r\n\r\nFIDE also awards titles for arbiters and trainers.[17][18] International titles are also awarded to composers and solvers of chess problems and to correspondence chess players (by the International Correspondence Chess Federation). National chess organizations may also award titles.\r\nTheory\r\nMain articles: Chess theory, Chess tactics, Chess strategy, Chess libraries, List of chess books, and List of chess periodicals\r\n\r\nChess has an extensive literature. In 1913, the chess historian H.J.R. Murray estimated the total number of books, magazines, and chess columns in newspapers to be about 5,000.[19] B.H. Wood estimated the number, as of 1949, to be about 20,000.[20] David Hooper and Kenneth Whyld write that, \"Since then there has been a steady increase year by year of the number of new chess publications. No one knows how many have been printed.\"[20] Significant public chess libraries include the John G. White Chess and Checkers Collection at Cleveland Public Library, with over 32,000 chess books and over 6,000 bound volumes of chess periodicals;[21] and the Chess & Draughts collection at the National Library of the Netherlands, with about 30,000 books.[22]\r\n\r\nChess theory usually divides the game of chess into three phases with different sets of strategies: the opening, typically the first 10 to 20 moves, when players move their pieces to useful positions for the coming battle; the middlegame; and last the endgame, when most of the pieces are gone, kings typically take a more active part in the struggle, and pawn promotion is often decisive.\r\n\r\nOpening theory is concerned with finding the best moves in the initial phase of the game. There are dozens of different openings, and hundreds of variants. The Oxford Companion to Chess lists 1,327 named openings and variants.[23]\r\n\r\nMiddlegame theory is usually divided into chess tactics and chess strategy. Chess strategy concentrates on setting and achieving long-term positional advantages during the game â€“ for example, where to place different pieces â€“ while tactics concerns immediate maneuver. These two aspects of the gameplay cannot be completely separated, because strategic goals are mostly achieved through tactics, while the tactical opportunities are based on the previous strategy of play.\r\n\r\nEndgame theory is concerned with positions where there are only a few pieces left. These positions are categorized according to the pieces, for example \"King and pawn\" endings or \"Rook versus minor piece\" endings.\r\nOpening\r\nMain article: Chess opening\r\n\r\nA chess opening is the group of initial moves of a game (the \"opening moves\"). Recognized sequences of opening moves are referred to as openings and have been given names such as the Ruy Lopez or Sicilian Defense. They are catalogued in reference works such as the Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings. There are dozens of different openings, varying widely in character from quiet positional play (for example, the RÃ©ti Opening) to very aggressive (the Latvian Gambit). In some opening lines, the exact sequence considered best for both sides has been worked out to more than 30 moves.[24] Professional players spend years studying openings and continue doing so throughout their careers, as opening theory continues to evolve.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental strategic aims of most openings are similar:[25]\r\n\r\n    Development: This is the technique of placing the pieces (particularly bishops and knights) on useful squares where they will have an optimal impact on the game.\r\n    Control of the center: Control of the central squares allows pieces to be moved to any part of the board relatively easily, and can also have a cramping effect on the opponent.\r\n    King safety: It is critical to keep the king safe from dangerous possibilities. A correctly timed castling can often enhance this.\r\n    Pawn structure: Players strive to avoid the creation of pawn weaknesses such as isolated, doubled, or backward pawns, and pawn islands â€“ and to force such weaknesses in the opponent\'s position.\r\n\r\nMost players and theoreticians consider that White, by virtue of the first move, begins the game with a small advantage. This initially gives White the initiative.[26] Black usually strives to neutralize White\'s advantage and achieve equality, or to develop dynamic counterplay in an unbalanced position.\r\nMiddlegame\r\nMain article: Chess middlegame\r\n\r\nThe middlegame is the part of the game that starts after the opening. There is no clear line between the opening and the middlegame, but typically the middlegame will start when most pieces have been developed. (Similarly, there is no clear transition from the middlegame to the endgame; see start of the endgame.) Because the opening theory has ended, players have to form plans based on the features of the position, and at the same time take into account the tactical possibilities of the position.[27] The middlegame is the phase in which most combinations occur. Combinations are a series of tactical moves executed to achieve some gain. Middlegame combinations are often connected with an attack against the opponent\'s king. Some typical patterns have their own names; for example, the Boden\'s Mate or the Laskerâ€“Bauer combination.[28]\r\n\r\nSpecific plans or strategic themes will often arise from particular groups of openings that result in a specific type of pawn structure. An example is the minority attack, which is the attack of queenside pawns against an opponent who has more pawns on the queenside. The study of openings is therefore connected to the preparation of plans that are typical of the resulting middlegames.[29]\r\n\r\nAnother important strategic question in the middlegame is whether and how to reduce material and transition into an endgame (i.e. simplify). Minor material advantages can generally be transformed into victory only in an endgame, and therefore the stronger side must choose an appropriate way to achieve an ending. Not every reduction of material is good for this purpose; for example, if one side keeps a light-squared bishop and the opponent has a dark-squared one, the transformation into a bishops and pawns ending is usually advantageous for the weaker side only, because an endgame with bishops on opposite colors is likely to be a draw, even with an advantage of a pawn, or sometimes even with a two-pawn advantage.[30]\r\nTactics\r\nMain article: Chess tactics\r\n\r\nIn chess, tactics in general concentrate on short-term actions â€“ so short-term that they can be calculated in advance by a human player or a computer. The possible depth of calculation depends on the player\'s ability. In quiet positions with many possibilities on both sides, a deep calculation is more difficult and may not be practical, while in positions with a limited number of forced variations, strong players can calculate long sequences of moves.\r\n\r\nTheoreticians describe many elementary tactical methods and typical maneuvers, for example: pins, forks, skewers, batteries, discovered attacks (especially discovered checks), zwischenzugs, deflections, decoys, sacrifices, underminings, overloadings, and interferences.[31] Simple one-move or two-move tactical actions â€“ threats, exchanges of material, and double attacks â€“ can be combined into more complicated sequences of tactical maneuvers that are often forced from the point of view of one or both players.[32] A forced variation that involves a sacrifice and usually results in a tangible gain is called a combination.[32] Brilliant combinations â€“ such as those in the Immortal Game â€“ are considered beautiful and are admired by chess lovers. A common type of chess exercise, aimed at developing players\' skills, is a position where a decisive combination is available and the challenge is to find it.[33] ', 0),

An average club player has a rating of about 1500; the highest FIDE rating of all time, 2882, was achieved by Magnus Carlsen on the March 2014 FIDE rating list.[14]\r\n\r\nPlayers may be awarded lifetime titles by FIDE:[16]\r\n\r\n    Grandmaster (GM; sometimes International Grandmaster or IGM is used) is awarded to world-class chess masters. Apart from World Champion, Grandmaster is the highest title a chess player can attain. Before FIDE will confer the title on a player, the player must have an Elo rating of at least 2500 at one time and three results of a prescribed standard (called norms) in tournaments involving other grandmasters, including some from countries other than the applicant\'s. There are other milestones a player can achieve to attain the title, such as winning the World Junior Championship.\r\n    International Master (IM). The conditions are similar to GM, but less demanding. The minimum rating for the IM title is 2400.\r\n    FIDE Master (FM). The usual way for a player to qualify for the FIDE Master title is by achieving a FIDE rating of 2300 or more.\r\n    Candidate Master (CM). Similar to FM, but with a FIDE rating of at least 2200.\r\n\r\nThe above titles are open to both men and women. There are also separate women-only titles; Woman Grandmaster (WGM), Woman International Master (WIM), Woman FIDE Master (WFM) and Woman Candidate Master (WCM). These require a performance level approximately 200 Elo rating points below the similarly named open titles, and their continued existence has sometimes been controversial. Beginning with Nona Gaprindashvili in 1978, a number of women have earned the open GM title: 40 as of July 2023.[note 2]\r\n\r\nFIDE also awards titles for arbiters and trainers.[17][18] International titles are also awarded to composers and solvers of chess problems and to correspondence chess players (by the International Correspondence Chess Federation). National chess organizations may also award titles.\r\nTheory\r\nMain articles: Chess theory, Chess tactics, Chess strategy, Chess libraries, List of chess books, and List of chess periodicals\r\n\r\nChess has an extensive literature. In 1913, the chess historian H.J.R. Murray estimated the total number of books, magazines, and chess columns in newspapers to be about 5,000.[19] B.H. Wood estimated the number, as of 1949, to be about 20,000.[20] David Hooper and Kenneth Whyld write that, \"Since then there has been a steady increase year by year of the number of new chess publications. No one knows how many have been printed.\"[20] Significant public chess libraries include the John G. White Chess and Checkers Collection at Cleveland Public Library, with over 32,000 chess books and over 6,000 bound volumes of chess periodicals;[21] and the Chess & Draughts collection at the National Library of the Netherlands, with about 30,000 books.[22]\r\n\r\nChess theory usually divides the game of chess into three phases with different sets of strategies: the opening, typically the first 10 to 20 moves, when players move their pieces to useful positions for the coming battle; the middlegame; and last the endgame, when most of the pieces are gone, kings typically take a more active part in the struggle, and pawn promotion is often decisive.\r\n\r\nOpening theory is concerned with finding the best moves in the initial phase of the game. There are dozens of different openings, and hundreds of variants. The Oxford Companion to Chess lists 1,327 named openings and variants.[23]\r\n\r\nMiddlegame theory is usually divided into chess tactics and chess strategy. Chess strategy concentrates on setting and achieving long-term positional advantages during the game â€“ for example, where to place different pieces â€“ while tactics concerns immediate maneuver. These two aspects of the gameplay cannot be completely separated, because strategic goals are mostly achieved through tactics, while the tactical opportunities are based on the previous strategy of play.\r\n\r\nEndgame theory is concerned with positions where there are only a few pieces left. These positions are categorized according to the pieces, for example \"King and pawn\" endings or \"Rook versus minor piece\" endings.\r\nOpening\r\nMain article: Chess opening\r\n\r\nA chess opening is the group of initial moves of a game (the \"opening moves\"). Recognized sequences of opening moves are referred to as openings and have been given names such as the Ruy Lopez or Sicilian Defense. They are catalogued in reference works such as the Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings. There are dozens of different openings, varying widely in character from quiet positional play (for example, the RÃ©ti Opening) to very aggressive (the Latvian Gambit). In some opening lines, the exact sequence considered best for both sides has been worked out to more than 30 moves.[24] Professional players spend years studying openings and continue doing so throughout their careers, as opening theory continues to evolve.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental strategic aims of most openings are similar:[25]\r\n\r\n    Development: This is the technique of placing the pieces (particularly bishops and knights) on useful squares where they will have an optimal impact on the game.\r\n    Control of the center: Control of the central squares allows pieces to be moved to any part of the board relatively easily, and can also have a cramping effect on the opponent.\r\n    King safety: It is critical to keep the king safe from dangerous possibilities.
